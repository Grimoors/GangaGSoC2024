the   bending   magnets   were   upgraded   to   safely   handle   the   current   required   for   7   TeV   per   beam   (14
TeV).[6][102] However, the bending magnets were only trained to handle up to 6.5 TeV per beam (13 TeV
total), which became the operating energy for 2015 to 2017.[82] The energy was ﬁrst reached on 10 April
2015.[103] The upgrades culminated in colliding protons together with a combined energy of 13 TeV.[104] On
3 June 2015, the LHC started delivering physics data after almost two years oﬄine.[105] In the following
months, it was used for proton-proton collisions, while in November, the machine switched to collisions of
lead ions and in December, the usual winter shutdown started.

In 2016, the machine operators focused on increasing the luminosity for proton-proton collisions. The design
value was ﬁrst reached 29 June,[39] and further improvements increased the collision rate to 40% above the
design value.[106] The total number of collisions in 2016 exceeded the number from Run 1 – at a higher
energy per collision. The proton-proton run was followed by four weeks of proton-lead collisions.[107]

In 2017, the luminosity was increased further and reached twice the design value. The total number of
collisions was higher than in 2016 as well.[40]

The 2018 physics run began on 17 April and stopped on 3 December, including four weeks of lead–lead
collisions.[108]

Long Shutdown 2 (2018–2021) and beyond

Long Shutdown 2 (LS2) started 10 December 2018. The LHC and the whole CERN accelerator complex is
being   maintained   and   upgraded.   The   goal   of   the   upgrades   is   to   implement   the  High   Luminosity   Large
Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) project that will increase the luminosity by a factor of 10. LS2 is projected to
end in 2021, followed by Run 3.[109] The HL-LHC should be operational by 2026. The Long Shutdown
(LS3) in 2020s will take place before HL-LHC project is done.
