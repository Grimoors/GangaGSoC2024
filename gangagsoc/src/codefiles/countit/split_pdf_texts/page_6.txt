Large Hadron Collider - Wikipedia

computer network infrastructure initially connecting 140 computing centres in 35 countries (over 170 in 36
countries as of 2012). It was designed by CERN to handle the signiﬁcant volume of data produced by LHC
experiments,[49][50] incorporating both private ﬁbre optic cable links and existing high-speed portions of the
public Internet to enable data transfer from CERN to academic institutions around the world.[51] The Open
Science Grid is used as the primary infrastructure in the United States, and also as part of an interoperable
federation with the LHC Computing Grid.

The distributed computing project LHC@home was started to support the construction and calibration of the
LHC. The project uses the BOINC platform, enabling anybody with an Internet connection and a computer
running Mac OS X, Windows or Linux to use their computer's idle time to simulate how particles will travel
in the beam pipes. With this information, the scientists are able to determine how the magnets should be
calibrated to gain the most stable "orbit" of the beams in the ring.[52] In August 2011, a second application
(Test4Theory) went live which performs simulations against which to compare actual test data, to determine
conﬁdence levels of the results.

By 2012, data from over 6 quadrillion (6 x 1015) LHC proton-proton collisions had been analysed,[53] LHC
collision data was being produced at approximately 25 petabytes per year, and the LHC Computing Grid had
become the world's largest computing grid in 2012, comprising over 170 computing facilities in a worldwide
network across 36 countries.[54][55][56]

Operational history

The LHC ﬁrst went live on 10 September 2008,[57] but initial testing was delayed for 14 months from 19
September 2008 to 20 November 2009, following a magnet quench incident that caused extensive damage to
over 50 superconducting magnets, their mountings, and the vacuum pipe.[58][59][60][61][62]

During its ﬁrst run (2010–2013), the LHC collided two opposing particle beams of either protons at up to
4   teraelectronvolts (4   TeV   or   0.64   microjoules),   or   lead nuclei   (574   TeV  per   nucleus,   or   2.76   TeV   per
nucleon).[63][64] Its ﬁrst run discoveries included the long-sought Higgs boson, several composite particles
(hadrons)   like   the   χb   (3P)   bottomonium   state,   the   ﬁrst   creation   of   a   quark–gluon   plasma,   and   the   ﬁrst
0 → μ+μ−), which challenged the
observations of the very rare decay of the Bs meson into two muons (Bs
validity of existing models of supersymmetry.[65]

Construction

Operational challenges

The size of the LHC constitutes an exceptional engineering challenge with unique operational issues on
account of the amount of energy stored in the magnets and the beams.[41][66] While operating, the total
energy stored in the magnets is 10 GJ (2,400 kilograms of TNT) and the total energy carried by the two
beams reaches 724 MJ (173 kilograms of TNT).[67]

Loss of only one ten-millionth part (10−7) of the beam is suﬃcient to quench a superconducting magnet,
while each of the two beam dumps must absorb 362 MJ (87 kilograms of TNT). These energies are carried
by very little matter: under nominal operating conditions (2,808 bunches per beam, 1.15×1011 protons per
bunch), the beam pipes contain 1.0×10−9 gram of hydrogen, which, in standard conditions for temperature
and pressure, would ﬁll the volume of one grain of ﬁne sand.
