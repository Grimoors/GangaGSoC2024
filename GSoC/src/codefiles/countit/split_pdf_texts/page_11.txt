Event

10 Sep 2008

CERN successfully ﬁred the ﬁrst protons around the entire tunnel circuit in
stages.

19 Sep 2008

Magnetic quench occurred in about 100 bending magnets in sectors 3 and 4,
causing a loss of approximately 6 tonnes of liquid helium.

30 Sep 2008

First "modest" high-energy collisions planned but postponed due to
accident.[32]

16 Oct 2008

CERN released a preliminary analysis of the accident.

21 Oct 2008

Oﬃcial inauguration.

5 Dec 2008

CERN released detailed analysis.

20 Nov 2009

Low-energy beams circulated in the tunnel for the ﬁrst time since the
accident.[61]

23 Nov 2009

First particle collisions in all four detectors at 450 GeV.

30 Nov 2009

LHC becomes the world's highest-energy particle accelerator achieving
1.18 TeV per beam, beating the Tevatron's previous record of 0.98 TeV per
beam held for eight years.[110]

15 Dec 2009

First scientiﬁc results, covering 284 collisions in the ALICE detector.[111]

30 Mar 2010

The two beams collided at 7 TeV (3.5 TeV per beam) in the LHC at 13:06
CEST, marking the start of the LHC research programme.

8 Nov 2010

Start of the ﬁrst run with lead ions.

6 Dec 2010

End of the run with lead ions. Shutdown until early 2011.

13 Mar 2011

Beginning of the 2011 run with proton beams.[112]

21 Apr 2011

LHC becomes the world's highest-luminosity hadron accelerator achieving a
peak luminosity of 4.67·1032 cm−2s−1, beating the Tevatron's previous
record of 4·1032 cm−2s−1 held for one year.[113]

24 May 2011

ALICE reports that a Quark–gluon plasma has been achieved with earlier lead
collisions.[114]

17 Jun 2011

The high-luminosity experiments ATLAS and CMS reach 1 fb−1 of collected
data.[115]

14 Oct 2011

LHCb reaches 1 fb−1 of collected data.[116]

23 Oct 2011

The high-luminosity experiments ATLAS and CMS reach 5 fb−1 of collected
data.

Nov 2011

Second run with lead ions.

22 Dec 2011

First new composite particle discovery, the χb (3P) bottomonium meson,
observed with proton-proton collisions in 2011.[117]

5 Apr 2012

First collisions with stable beams in 2012 after the winter shutdown. The
energy is increased to 4 TeV per beam (8 TeV in collisions).[118]
