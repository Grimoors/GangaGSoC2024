Background

The term hadron refers to subatomic composite particles composed
of quarks held together by the strong force (as atoms and molecules
are held together by the electromagnetic force).[12] The best-known
hadrons are the baryons such as protons and neutrons;   hadrons
also   include   mesons   such   as   the   pion   and   kaon,   which   were
discovered during cosmic ray experiments in the late 1940s and
early 1950s.[13]

A collider is a type of a particle accelerator  with  two   directed
beams   of   particles.   In   particle   physics,   colliders   are   used   as   a
research   tool:   they   accelerate   particles   to   very   high   kinetic
energies and let them impact other particles.[1]  Analysis of   the
byproducts of these collisions gives scientists good evidence of
the   structure   of   the   subatomic   world   and   the   laws   of   nature
governing   it.   Many   of   these   byproducts   are   produced   only   by
high-energy collisions, and they decay after very short periods of
time. Thus many of them are hard or nearly impossible to study in
other ways.[14]

Purpose

Many physicists hope that the Large Hadron Collider will help
answer some of the fundamental open questions in physics, which
concern   the   basic   laws   governing   the   interactions   and   forces
among the elementary objects, the deep structure of space and
time,   and   in   particular   the   interrelation   between   quantum
