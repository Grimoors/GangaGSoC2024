An initial focus of research was to investigate the possible existence of the Higgs boson, a key part of the
Standard Model of physics which is predicted by theory, but had not yet been observed before due to its high
mass and elusive nature. CERN scientists estimated that, if the Standard Model were correct, the LHC would
produce several Higgs bosons every minute, allowing physicists to ﬁnally conﬁrm or disprove the Higgs
boson's   existence.   In   addition,   the   LHC   allowed   the   search   for   supersymmetric   particles   and   other
hypothetical particles as possible unknown areas of physics.[63] Some extensions of the Standard Model
predict additional particles, such as the heavy W' and Z' gauge bosons, which are also estimated to be within
reach of the LHC to discover.[125]

First run (data taken 2009–2013)

The ﬁrst physics results from the LHC, involving 284 collisions which took place in the ALICE detector,
were reported on 15 December 2009.[111] The results of the ﬁrst proton–proton collisions at energies higher
than Fermilab's Tevatron proton–antiproton collisions were published by the CMS   collaboration   in   early
February 2010, yielding greater-than-predicted charged-hadron production.[126]

After   the   ﬁrst   year   of   data   collection,   the   LHC   experimental   collaborations   started   to   release   their
preliminary   results   concerning   searches   for   new   physics   beyond   the   Standard   Model   in   proton-proton
collisions.[127][128][129][130] No evidence of new particles was detected in the 2010 data. As a result, bounds
were set on the allowed parameter space of various extensions of the Standard Model, such as models with
large extra dimensions, constrained versions of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, and others.
[131][132][133]

On 24 May 2011, it was reported that quark–gluon plasma (the densest matter thought to exist besides black
holes) had been created in the LHC.[114]

Between   July   and   August   2011,   results   of   searches   for   the   Higgs
boson and for exotic particles, based on the data collected during the
ﬁrst   half   of   the   2011   run,   were   presented   in   conferences   in
Grenoble[134]   and   Mumbai.[135]   In   the   latter   conference,   it   was
reported that, despite hints of a Higgs signal in earlier data, ATLAS
and CMS exclude with 95% conﬁdence level (using the CLs method)
the existence of a Higgs boson with the properties predicted by the
Standard Model over most of the mass region between 145 and 466
GeV.[136] The searches for new particles did not yield signals either,
allowing   to   further   constrain   the   parameter   space   of   various
extensions   of   the   Standard   Model,   including   its   supersymmetric
extensions.[137][138]

the Higgs boson may be
produced at the LHC. Here, two
quarks each emit a W or Z
boson, which combine to make
a neutral Higgs.

On   13   December   2011,   CERN   reported   that   the   Standard   Model
Higgs boson, if it exists, is most likely to have a mass constrained to
the range 115–130 GeV. Both the CMS and ATLAS detectors have
also   shown   intensity   peaks   in   the   124–125   GeV   range,   consistent   with   either   background   noise   or   the
observation of the Higgs boson.[139]

On   22   December   2011,   it   was   reported   that   a   new   composite   particle   had   been   observed,   the   χb   (3P)
bottomonium state.[117]

On 4 July 2012, both the CMS and ATLAS teams announced the discovery of a boson in the mass region
around 125–126 GeV, with a statistical signiﬁcance at the level of 5 sigma each. This meets the formal level
required to announce a new particle. The observed properties were consistent with the Higgs boson, but
scientists were cautious as to whether it is formally identiﬁed as actually being the Higgs boson, pending
