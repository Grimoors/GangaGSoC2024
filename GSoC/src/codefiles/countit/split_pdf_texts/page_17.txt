18. "... in the public presentations of the aspiration of particle physics we hear too

often that the goal of the LHC or a linear collider is to check oﬀ the last missing
particle of the Standard Model, this year's Holy Grail of particle physics, the Higgs
boson. The truth is much less boring than that! What we're trying to accomplish is
much more exciting, and asking what the world would have been like without the
Higgs mechanism is a way of getting at that excitement." – Chris Quigg (2005).

both the Higgs boson and other new phenomena will be found with the
LHC."..."This mass threshold means, among other things, that something new –
either a Higgs boson or other novel phenomena – is to be found when the LHC
turns the thought experiment into a real one."Chris Quigg (February 2008). "The
