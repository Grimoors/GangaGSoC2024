and take over the world. It is also involved in mass vigilance through the "ECHELON" project and has
connection with many mercenary groups worldwide, to avoid the creation of other time machines.

The novel FlashForward, by Robert J. Sawyer, involves the search for the Higgs boson at the LHC. CERN
published a "Science and Fiction" page interviewing Sawyer and physicists about the book and the TV series
based on it.[177]

In the American Dad episode The 200, Roger accidentally falls into the Large Hadron Collider, resulting in a
huge explosion that creates two hundred clones of his multiple personas.

"The Large Hadron Collision" is the ﬁfteenth episode of the third season of the American sitcom The Big
Bang Theory in which Leonard (a character in the show) is oﬀered a chance to visit the Large Hadron
Collider.
