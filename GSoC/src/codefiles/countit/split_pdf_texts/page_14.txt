further analysis.[140] On 14 March 2013, CERN announced conﬁrmation that the observed particle was
indeed the predicted Higgs Boson.[141]

On 8 November 2012, the LHCb team reported on an experiment seen as a "golden" test of supersymmetry
theories in physics,[120] by measuring the very rare decay of the

The   results,   which   match   those   predicted   by   the   non-supersymmetrical   Standard   Model   rather   than   the
predictions of many branches of supersymmetry, show the decays are less common than some forms of
supersymmetry predict, though could still match the predictions of other versions of supersymmetry theory.
The results as initially drafted are stated to be short of proof but at a relatively high 3.5 sigma   level   of
signiﬁcance.[142] The result was later conﬁrmed by the CMS collaboration.[143]

In August 2013, the LHCb team revealed an anomaly in the angular distribution of B meson decay products
which could not be predicted by the Standard Model; this anomaly had a statistical certainty of 4.5 sigma,
just short of the 5 sigma needed to be oﬃcially recognized as a discovery. It is unknown what the cause of
this anomaly would be, although the Z' boson has been suggested as a possible candidate.[144]

On   19   November   2014,   the   LHCb   experiment   announced   the   discovery   of   two   new   heavy   subatomic
particles, Ξ′−
strange quark. They are excited states of the bottom Xi baryon.[145][146]

The LHCb collaboration has observed multiple exotic hadrons, possibly pentaquarks or tetraquarks, in the
Run 1 data. On 4 April 2014, the collaboration conﬁrmed the existence of the tetraquark candidate Z(4430)
with a signiﬁcance of over 13.9 sigma.[147][148] On 13 July 2015, results consistent with pentaquark states in

On 28 June 2016, the collaboration announced four tetraquark-like particles decaying into a J/ψ and a φ
meson,   only   one   of   which   was   well   established   before   (X(4274),   X(4500)   and   X(4700)   and   X(4140)).

In December 2016, ATLAS presented a measurement of the W boson mass, researching the precision of
analyses done at the Tevatron.[154]

Second run (2015-2018)

At the conference EPS-HEP 2015 in July, the collaborations presented ﬁrst cross-section measurements of
several particles at the higher collision energy.

On 15 December 2015, the ATLAS and CMS experiments both reported a number of preliminary results for
Higgs physics, supersymmetry (SUSY) searches and exotics searches using 13 TeV proton collision data.
Both   experiments   saw   a   moderate   excess   around   750   GeV   in   the   two-photon   invariant   mass   spectrum,
[155][156][157] but the experiments did not conﬁrm the existence of the hypothetical particle in an August
2016 report.[158][159][160]

In July 2017, many analyses based on the large dataset collected in 2016 were shown. The properties of the
Higgs boson were studied in more detail and the precision of many other results was improved.[161]

Planned "high-luminosity" upgrade

After some years of running, any particle physics experiment typically begins to suﬀer from diminishing
returns: as the key results reachable by the device begin to be completed, later years of operation discover
proportionately less than earlier years. A common response is to upgrade the devices involved, typically in
