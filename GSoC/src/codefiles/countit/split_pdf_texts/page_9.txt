two further vacuum leaks identiﬁed in July 2009; this pushed the start of operations to November of that
year.[81]

Run 1: ﬁrst operational run (2009–2013)

On 20 November 2009, low-energy beams circulated in the tunnel for
the ﬁrst time since the incident, and shortly after, on 30 November,
the LHC achieved 1.18 TeV per beam to become the world's highest-
energy particle accelerator, beating the Tevatron's previous record of
0.98 TeV per beam held for eight years.[94]

The   early   part   of   2010   saw   the   continued   ramp-up   of   beam   in
energies and early physics experiments towards 3.5 TeV per beam
and   on   30   March   2010,   LHC   set   a   new   record   for   high-energy
collisions by colliding proton beams at a combined energy level of
7 TeV. The attempt was the third that day, after two unsuccessful
attempts in which the protons had to be "dumped" from the collider
and new beams had to be injected.[95] This also marked the start of the main research programme.

The ﬁrst proton run ended on 4 November 2010. A run with lead ions started on 8 November 2010, and
ended on 6 December 2010,[96] allowing the ALICE experiment to study matter under extreme conditions
similar to those shortly after the Big Bang.[97]

CERN originally planned that the LHC would run through to the end of 2012, with a short break at the end
of 2011 to allow for an increase in beam energy from 3.5 to 4 TeV per beam.[5] At the end of 2012, the LHC
was planned to get shut down until around 2015 to allow upgrade to a planned beam energy of 7 TeV per
beam.[98] In late 2012, in light of the July 2012 discovery of the Higgs boson, the shutdown was postponed
for some weeks into early 2013, to allow additional data to be obtained before shutdown.

Long Shutdown 1 (2013–2015)

The LHC was shut down on 13 February 2013 for its 2-year upgrade
called Long Shutdown 1 (LS1), which was to touch on many aspects
of the LHC: enabling collisions at 14 TeV, enhancing its detectors
and   pre-accelerators   (the   Proton   Synchrotron   and   Super   Proton
Synchrotron), as well as replacing its ventilation system and 100 km
(62 mi) of cabling impaired by high-energy collisions from its ﬁrst
run.[99]   The   upgraded   collider   began   its   long   start-up   and   testing
process in June 2014, with the Proton Synchrotron Booster starting
on   2   June   2014,   the   ﬁnal   interconnection   between   magnets
completing and the Proton Synchrotron circulating particles on 18
June 2014, and the ﬁrst section of the main LHC supermagnet system reaching operating temperature of
1.9 K (−271.25 °C), a few days later.[100] Due to the slow progress with "training"   the   superconducting
magnets, it was decided to start the second run with a lower energy of 6.5 TeV per beam, corresponding to a
current of 11,000 amperes. The ﬁrst of the main LHC magnets were reported to have been successfully
trained by 9 December 2014, while training the other magnet sectors was ﬁnished in March 2015.[101]

Run 2: second operational run (2015–2018)

On 5 April 2015, the LHC restarted after a two-year break, during which the electrical connectors between
