collision energy, luminosity, or improved detectors. In addition to a possible increase to 14 TeV collision
energy, a luminosity upgrade of the LHC, called the High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider, started in June
2018 that will boost the accelerator's potential for new discoveries in physics, starting in 2027.[162]   The
upgrade aims at increasing the luminosity of the machine by a factor of 10, up to 1035 cm−2s−1, providing a
better chance to see rare processes and improving statistically marginal measurements.

Safety of particle collisions

The   experiments   at   the   Large   Hadron   Collider   sparked   fears   that   the   particle   collisions   might   produce
doomsday   phenomena,   involving   the   production   of   stable   microscopic   black   holes   or   the   creation   of
hypothetical   particles   called   strangelets.[163]   Two   CERN-commissioned   safety   reviews   examined   these
concerns and concluded that the experiments at the LHC present no danger and that there is no reason for
concern,[164][165][166] a conclusion endorsed by the American Physical Society.[167]

The reports also noted that the physical conditions and collision events that exist in the LHC and similar
experiments occur naturally and routinely in the universe without hazardous consequences,[165] including
ultra-high-energy cosmic rays observed to impact Earth with energies far higher than those in any man-made
collider.

Popular culture

The Large Hadron Collider gained a considerable amount of attention from outside the scientiﬁc community
and its progress is followed by most popular science media. The LHC has also inspired works of ﬁction
including novels, TV series, video games and ﬁlms.

CERN   employee   Katherine   McAlpine's   "Large   Hadron   Rap"[168]   surpassed   7   million   YouTube   views.
[169][170] The band Les Horribles Cernettes was founded by women from CERN. The name was chosen so to
have the same initials as the LHC.[171][172]

National   Geographic   Channel's   World's   Toughest   Fixes,   Season   2   (2010),   Episode   6   "Atom   Smasher"
features the replacement of the last superconducting magnet section in the repair of the collider after the
2008   quench   incident.   The   episode   includes   actual   footage   from   the   repair   facility   to   the   inside   of   the
collider, and explanations of the function, engineering, and purpose of the LHC.[173]

The Large Hadron Collider was the focus of the 2012 student ﬁlm Decay, with the movie being ﬁlmed on
location in CERN's maintenance tunnels.[174]

The   feature   documentary   Particle   Fever   follows   the   experimental   physicists   at   CERN   who   run   the
experiments, as well as the theoretical physicists who attempt to provide a conceptual framework for the
LHC's results. It won the Sheﬃeld International Doc/Fest in 2013.

Fiction

The novel Angels & Demons, by Dan Brown, involves antimatter created at the LHC to be used in a weapon
against the Vatican. In response, CERN published a "Fact or Fiction?" page discussing the accuracy of the
book's portrayal of the LHC, CERN, and particle physics in general.[175] The movie version of the book has
footage ﬁlmed on-site at one of the experiments at the LHC; the director, Ron Howard, met with CERN
experts in an eﬀort to make the science in the story more accurate.[176]

In   the   visual   novel/manga/anime-series   "Steins;Gate",   SERN   (a   deliberate   misspelling   of   CERN)   is   an
organization that uses the miniature black holes created from experiments in the LHC to master time travel
