4 Jul 2012

First new elementary particle discovery, a new boson observed that is
"consistent with" the theorized Higgs boson. (This has now been conﬁrmed
as the Higgs boson itself.[119])

8 Nov 2012

First observation of the very rare decay of the Bs meson into two muons (Bs
→ μ+μ−), a major test of supersymmetry theories,[120] shows results at 3.5
sigma that match the Standard Model rather than many of its super-
symmetrical variants.
