time to cool down magnets to their operating temperature of around 1.9 K (close to absolute zero). Over time
the magnet "beds in" and ceases to quench at these lesser currents and can handle the full design current
without quenching; CERN media describe the magnets as "shaking out" the unavoidable tiny manufacturing
imperfections in their crystals and positions that had initially impaired their ability to handle their planned
currents. The magnets, over time and with training, gradually become able to handle their full planned
currents without quenching.[82][83]

Inaugural tests (2008)

The   ﬁrst   beam   was   circulated   through   the   collider   on   the   morning   of   10   September   2008.[46] CERN
successfully ﬁred the protons around the tunnel in stages, three kilometres at a time. The particles were ﬁred
in a clockwise direction into the accelerator and successfully steered around it at 10:28 local time.[57] The
LHC successfully completed its major test: after a series of trial runs, two white dots ﬂashed on a computer
screen showing the protons travelled the full length of the collider. It took less than one hour to guide the
stream of particles around its inaugural circuit.[84] CERN next successfully sent a beam of protons in an
anticlockwise   direction,   taking   slightly   longer   at   one   and   a   half   hours   owing   to   a   problem   with   the
cryogenics, with the full circuit being completed at 14:59.

Quench incident

On 19 September 2008, a magnet quench occurred in about 100 bending magnets in sectors 3 and 4, where
an electrical fault led to a loss of approximately six tonnes of liquid helium (the magnets' cryogenic coolant),
which was vented into the tunnel. The escaping vapour expanded with explosive force, damaging a total of 53
superconducting magnets and their mountings, and contaminating the vacuum pipe, which also lost vacuum
conditions.[58][59][85]

Shortly after the incident, CERN reported that the most likely cause of the problem was a faulty electrical
connection between two magnets, and that – owing to the time needed to warm up the aﬀected sectors and
then cool them back down to operating temperature – it would take at least two months to ﬁx.[86] CERN
released an interim technical report[85] and preliminary analysis of the incident on 15 and 16 October 2008
respectively,[87] and a more detailed report on 5 December 2008.[79] The analysis of the incident by CERN
conﬁrmed   that   an   electrical   fault   had   indeed   been   the   cause.   The   faulty   electrical   connection   had   led
(correctly) to a failsafe power abort of the electrical systems powering the superconducting magnets, but had
also caused an electric arc (or discharge) which damaged the integrity of the supercooled helium's enclosure
and vacuum insulation, causing the coolant's temperature and pressure to rapidly rise beyond the ability of
the safety systems to contain it,[85] and leading to a temperature rise of about 100 degrees Celsius in some of
the aﬀected magnets. Energy stored in the superconducting magnets and electrical noise induced in other
quench   detectors   also   played   a   role   in   the   rapid   heating.   Around   two   tonnes   of   liquid   helium   escaped
explosively before detectors triggered an emergency stop, and a further four tonnes leaked at lower pressure
in the aftermath.[85] A total of 53 magnets were damaged in the incident and were repaired or replaced
during   the   winter   shutdown.[88]   This   accident   was   thoroughly   discussed   in   a   22   February   2010
Superconductor Science and Technology article by CERN physicist Lucio Rossi.[89]

In the original schedule for LHC commissioning, the ﬁrst "modest" high-energy collisions at a centre-of-
mass energy of 900 GeV were expected to take place before the end of September 2008, and the LHC was
expected to be operating at 10 TeV by the end of 2008.[90] However, owing to the delay caused by the
incident, the collider was not operational until November 2009.[91] Despite the delay, LHC was oﬃcially
inaugurated on 21 October 2008, in the presence of political leaders, science ministers from CERN's 20
Member States, CERN oﬃcials, and members of the worldwide scientiﬁc community.[92]

Most of 2009 was spent on repairs and reviews from the damage caused by the quench incident, along with
