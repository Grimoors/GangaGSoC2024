The   3.8-metre   (12   ft)   wide   concrete-lined   tunnel,   constructed
between   1983   and   1988,   was   formerly   used   to   house   the   Large
Electron–Positron   Collider.[30]   The   tunnel   crosses   the   border
between Switzerland and France at four points, with most of it in
France.   Surface   buildings   hold   ancillary   equipment   such   as
compressors,   ventilation   equipment,   control   electronics   and
refrigeration plants.

Collider at CERN

The   collider   tunnel   contains
  parallel
two  
beamlines   (or   beam   pipes)
each   containing   a   beam,
which   travel   in   opposite
directions   around   the   ring.
The   beams   intersect   at   four
points around the ring, which
is   where   the   particle   collisions   take   place.   Some   1,232   dipole
magnets keep the beams on their circular path (see image[31]), while
an additional 392 quadrupole magnets are used to keep the beams
focused, with stronger quadrupole magnets close to the intersection
points in order to maximize the chances of interaction where the two
beams cross. Magnets of higher multipole orders are used to correct
smaller imperfections in the ﬁeld geometry. In total, about 10,000
superconducting   magnets   are   installed,   with   the   dipole   magnets
having   a   mass   of   over   27   tonnes.[32]   Approximately   96   tonnes   of
superﬂuid helium-4 is needed to keep the magnets, made of copper-
clad niobium-titanium, at their operating temperature of 1.9 K (−271.25 °C), making the LHC the largest
cryogenic   facility   in   the   world   at   liquid   helium   temperature.   LHC   uses   470   tonnes   of   Nb–Ti
superconductor.[33]

Superconducting quadrupole
electromagnets are used to
direct the beams to four
intersection points, where
interactions between
accelerated protons will take
place.

During   LHC   operations,   the   CERN   site   draws   roughly   200   MW   of   electrical   power   from   the   French
electrical grid, which, for comparison, is about one-third the energy consumption of the city of Geneva; the
LHC accelerator and detectors draw about 120 MW thereof.[34] Each day of its operation generates 140
terabytes of data.[35]

When running at the current energy record of 6.5 TeV per proton,[36] once or twice a day, as the protons are
accelerated from 450 GeV to 6.5 TeV, the ﬁeld of the superconducting dipole magnets is increased from 0.54
to 7.7 teslas (T). The protons each have an energy of 6.5 TeV, giving a total collision energy of 13 TeV. At
this energy, the protons have a Lorentz factor of about 6,930 and move at about 0.999 999 990 c, or about
3.1 m/s (11 km/h) slower than the speed of light (c). It takes less than 90 microseconds (μs) for a proton to
travel 26.7 km around the main ring. This results in 11,245 revolutions per second for protons whether the
particles are at low or high energy in the main ring, since the speed diﬀerence between these energies is
beyond the ﬁfth decimal.[37]

Rather than having continuous beams, the protons are bunched together, into up to 2,808 bunches, with
115 billion protons in each bunch so that interactions between the two beams take place at discrete intervals,
mainly 25 nanoseconds (ns) apart, providing a bunch collision rate of 40 MHz. It was operated with fewer
bunches in the ﬁrst years. The design luminosity of the LHC is 1034 cm−2s−1,[38] which was ﬁrst reached in
June 2016.[39] By 2017, twice this value was achieved.[40]

Before   being   injected   into   the   main   accelerator,   the   particles   are   prepared   by   a   series   of   systems   that
successively increase their energy. The ﬁrst system is the linear particle accelerator LINAC 4 generating 160-
MeV negative hydrogen ions (H− ions), which feeds the Proton Synchrotron Booster (PSB). There, both
