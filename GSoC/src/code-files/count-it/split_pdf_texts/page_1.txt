Large Hadron Collider

The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is the world's largest and
highest-energy   particle   collider   and   the   largest   machine   in   the
world.[1][2] It was built by the European Organization for Nuclear
Research (CERN) between 1998 and 2008 in collaboration with
over   10,000   scientists   and   hundreds   of   universities   and
laboratories, as well as more than 100 countries.[3]  It  lies  in  a
tunnel 27 kilometres (17 mi) in circumference and as deep as 175
metres   (574   ft)   beneath   the   France–Switzerland   border   near
Geneva.

The   ﬁrst   collisions   were   achieved   in   2010   at   an   energy   of
3.5   teraelectronvolts   (TeV)   per   beam,   about   four   times   the
previous world record.[4][5] After upgrades it reached 6.5 TeV per
beam (13 TeV total collision energy, the present world record).
[6][7][8][9]   At   the   end   of   2018,   it   entered   a   two-year   shutdown
period for further upgrades.

The collider has four crossing points, around which are positioned
seven detectors, each designed for certain kinds of research. The
LHC primarily collides proton beams, but it can also use beams
of heavy ions: lead–lead collisions and proton–lead collisions are
typically   done   for   one   month   per   year.   The   aim   of   the   LHC's
detectors is to allow physicists to test the predictions of diﬀerent
theories of particle physics, including measuring the properties of
the  Higgs  boson[10]   and   searching   for   the   large   family   of   new
particles   predicted   by   supersymmetric   theories,[11]   as   well   as
other unsolved questions of physics.
